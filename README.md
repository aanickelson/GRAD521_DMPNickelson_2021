# GRAD521_DMPNickelson_2021

Context of the project for this DMP:

My research focuses on how to enable robots to utilize contextual information within their environment to make more informed decisions. Contextual information can include dynamic elements (people walking around), specific objects (differentiating between a chair and a table), or the task they are working on. Our research looks at how the context in which the robot operates should impact the decisions it makes. For example, if the robot is carrying a delicate object, it should take that into consideration when planning a path to its destination; the goal would be to have it plan a path that has minimal disturbances, instead of the standard path that only minimizes the distance.
